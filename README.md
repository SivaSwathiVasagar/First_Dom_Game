Welcome to the Memory Matching Game - Halloween Theme! This project marks my inaugural foray into the realm of game development, crafted as part of my journey through the Per Scholas Software Engineering cohort.

## <span style="color: #ff9f1c; font= 2px;"> Introduction</span>

The Memory Matching Game offers players an opportunity to hone their cognitive abilities while immersing themselves in a Halloween-themed environment. The game board contains a collection of 16 tiles, each concealing a distinctive image, and challenges players to uncover matching pairs within a stipulated time frame.

- **High Score Tracking:** Keep track of your top performance with a high-score feature that immortalizes your finest achievements.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience across a spectrum of devices, as the game adapts its layout to suit varying screen sizes.

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: [First_Dom_Game](https://github.com/SivaSwathiVasagar/First_Dom_Game).
2. Open the game using your preferred browser.
3. Click anywhere on the start screen to initiate gameplay.
4. Uncover tiles by clicking on them, aiming to match pairs of identical images.
5. The game concludes with a victory screen upon successful completion, or a game over screen if time elapses.
6. In either scenario, a click anywhere on the screen reinvigorates the game for your subsequent engagement.

A pivotal obstacle in the development process pertained to score resetting. The persistence of prior scores was causing discrepancies as the game mistakenly updated scores upon re-clicking the same card. To surmount this, I imposed a temporary click prohibition on revealed cards, mitigating the possibility of multiple erroneous score updates.

The captivating Halloween-themed background image was downloaded from an online resource, subsequently fine-tuned to match the aesthetic I envisioned through the utilization of Figma, a prominent design tool.

Future plans for this project encompass the expansion into multiplayer functionality, encompassing a range of difficulty levels, thereby enriching the gameplay experience.
